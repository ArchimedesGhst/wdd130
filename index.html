                Hello, my name is Chris Walker. I am from Clovis California originally, but I currently live in Saratoga Springs Utah. I served my mission in Kaohsiung Taiwan speaking Mandarin Chinese. I have been married almost 20 years now and my oldest son of 3 boys is currently 6 months into his mission in Littlerock Arkansas Spanish-Speaking. I have had just about every job under the sun, from working as a lifeguard, emt, and construction worker, to a police officer and for the last eleven years I have been working as a Data and Software engineer. I am hoping that by getting my Bachelors Degree I will have better opportunities opened up and I will become a better rounded developer.
